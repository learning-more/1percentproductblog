# Starter kit for [Alembic](https://alembic.darn.es/) with Netlify CMS

This is the personal blog of Charles Wilson. I'll mostly focus on finding problems and solving them with products and services. 

I'm using Alembic [as a Jekyll theme gem](https://alembic.darn.es/#as-a-jekyll-theme) with Netlify CMS because if I have to recover Wordpress one more time, I'm going to...nope. I'm not going to start complaining about Wordpress. There are some weaknesses, but I'm happy of the impact it has made on the world. 

If you want this stack, you can [![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic-netlifycms-kit&stack=cms)
