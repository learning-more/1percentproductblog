Hi. The more senses attached to a memory, the better the recall. Supposedly, when smell is attached to a memory, the retrieval can be intense. Unfortunatly, most of my experience building products and services for people don't have many smells attached to them. :)
However, I can write, and have hope that some of the great learnings that are presented to me are remembered. 

The best Product Managers (or anyone, for that matter) seemed to be very aware of what they had done. Thinking and acting are such important things. So, let's think together.

What is your opinion on generic "about" pages? I'm not a fan. If someone takes the time to create a website, they should add an about page to help readers. 

My goal is to share thoughts on what I'm still figuring out in Product Management. I could say this site is about what I've learned, but that communicates a sense of finality. Perhaps you are solving the same problems I am. Let's chat.
